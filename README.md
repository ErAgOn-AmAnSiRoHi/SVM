# SVM

SVM stands for Support Vector Machine. It is one of the most popular Supervised Learning Algorithm which is used for Classification as well as Regression.

The goal is to find the best line or decision boundary that can divide n-dimensional space into classes so that we can easily classify new data points.
This best decision boundary is referred to as a hyperplane.

SVM selects the extreme points/vectors that aid in the creation of the hyperplane. Support vectors are the names given to these extreme cases.

SVM is of two types:
> Linear SVM [](Linear SVM/)        { used for linearly separable data }   
>    Non-Linear SVM [](Non-Linear SVM/)    { used for non-linearly separated data }

Except for Hard Margin SVM, I have considered [Checker Board Dataset](DataSets/Readme.md) under consideration for training my model and then taken random values to check for the classification.
